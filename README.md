# Log Plotter

Some 3D Printers Output Log Files with a ton of information. I made a tool to parse through these log files and filter for key words that could be vital for debugging a machine. 

For machines capable of laser bed leveling there is support using regular expressions and mathlab to graph the output of the laser and determine the high and low points of your bed/ gantry.

**This is a work in progress**
